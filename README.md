Begemotic MVP

The microservice implements two main methods based on information from the database:
1) '/radius_aggregation' - calculate aggregation within a radius of hexes from a point;
2) '/polygon_aggregation' - calculate the aggregation in the given polygon.

Used technologies: FastAPI, uvicorn, h3, GeoJSON, Pydantic, Docker-Compose.

How to run?

The project launch is in two parts: build and start.

Build:

        $ sudo docker-compose build


Launch:

        $ sudo docker-compose up

Stops containers and remove containers, imagesâ€¦ created by docker-compose up:

        $ sudo docker-compose down

Lists containers:

        $ sudo docker-compose ps

Lists images:

        $ sudo docker-compose images

Examples of using:

After launch, you can use the functionality of the microservice by opening the link http://localhost:8000/docs
